# Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals: Describe the concepts of security, compliance, and identity

Let's break down what you'll learn:

1. **Shared Responsibility Model:** This model delineates responsibilities between a cloud service provider and its users. It defines who is responsible for what in terms of security measures, typically varying depending on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
2. **Defense in Depth:** This approach employs multiple layers of security mechanisms to protect information and systems. The idea is that if one layer is breached, others are in place to prevent further compromises.
3. **Zero Trust Model:** This model operates under the assumption that no entity, whether inside or outside the network, should be trusted by default. Access controls and verification are applied rigorously regardless of location.
4. **Encryption and Hashing:** Encryption involves converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. Hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters, providing a unique identifier for that data.
5. **Compliance Concepts:** Understanding the basics of compliance ensures that organizations adhere to legal, regulatory, and industry standards concerning data protection and privacy.
