As organizations establish GRC competency they can establish a framework that includes implementing specific policies, operational processes, and technologies. A structured approach for managing GRC helps organizations reduce risk and improve compliance effectiveness.

An important prerequisite to establishing GRC competency is understanding the key terms.

**Governance**

1. Governance is the system of rules, practices, and processes used to control and direct an organization's activities.
2. Many of these governance activities are created due to external standards, obligations, and expectations.
3. Organizations establish rules and processes that define:
   * Who can access corporate resources.
   * What they can access.
   * Where they can access it from.
   * When they can access it.
   * Who has administrative privileges.
   * How long administrative privileges are granted.
4. This suggests that external factors play a significant role in shaping an organization's governance framework.

**Risk**

1. **Definition:** Risk management is a process for identifying, assessing, and responding to threats or events that can impact a company's or customer's objectives.
2. **Sources of Risk:** Risks can come from both external and internal sources.
3. **External Risks:** These risks come from outside the organization and can include political and economic forces, weather events, pandemics, and security breaches.
4. **Internal Risks:** These risks originate within the organization and can include leaks of sensitive data, intellectual property theft, fraud, and insider trading.
5. **Importance:** Risk management is essential for protecting a company's assets, reputation, and financial stability.

**Compliance**

**Compliance:**

* Refers to laws and regulations governing data protection.
* Different laws apply depending on location (country/region, state, federal, multinational).
* Defines what data needs protection, processes required, and penalties for non-compliance.
* **Not the same as security:** Security is important for compliance but compliance only requires meeting minimum legal standards.

**Compliance-related concepts:**

* **Data residency:** Regulations governing where data can be stored and accessed.
* **Data sovereignty:** Data is subject to laws of the country/region it's collected, stored, or processed.
* **Data privacy:** Transparency about data collection, use, and sharing is crucial.
* **Personal data:** Any information linked to an identifiable person.
* **Organizations must comply with multiple laws and standards related to data privacy.**

**Understanding compliance terminology and concepts is important for all organizations managing data.**
